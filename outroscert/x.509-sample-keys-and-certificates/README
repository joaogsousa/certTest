Introduction:

Here you find a sample collection of X.509 digital certificates with associated public/private keys in Java Key Store (.jks) format. You can use them to test your applications (say Web services and clients). They were generated by the jkscertgen tool that I wrote some time ago. It's a shell script that can be used to generate keys, certificates and sign them very easily. You can download the script from http://www.swview.org/jkscertgen . You can customize the script and generate aditional keys and certificates. Or else, just open the script in a text editor to learn how to generate the keys, certificates, signing them and working with .jks files.


Keys and certiciates for 4 owners exist:

1. swviewca (A self signed certiciate authority)
2. myservice (Meant to be used with a service - like a Web service)
3. jack (Represents a client that uses the service)
4. johnie (Represents another client that uses the service)

The use-these-jks-files directory contains 4 .jks files for the above 4 principles.


What's included in Java Key Store (.jks) files:

1. swviewca.jks
  public/private keys of swviewca
